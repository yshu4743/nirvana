							<p>The Ice Apple, or Borassus flabellifer, is a translucent tropical jewel harvested from the majestic Palmyra Palm, a tree steeped in over two millennia of history. Known in ancient Tamil scriptures as the Karpaha Veruksham or "Celestial Tree," its leaves once served as the original parchment for Asia's earliest manuscripts. This "Tree of Life" remains a cultural icon across Southern India and Southeast Asia, symbolizing resilience and divine bounty. The harvest is a masterclass in ancestral precision: skilled artisans climb branchless trunks reaching 30 meters high, using traditional techniques passed down through generations. Each rugged husk is hand-carved at the precise peak of tenderness to reveal the delicate, jelly-like seeds within. Composed of 90% water and vital electrolytes, this ancient superfood acts as a powerful natural coolant, merging historic legacy with modern cellular hydration to refresh the global stage.</p>
